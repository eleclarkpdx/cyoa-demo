"Fer this, I'll need to ask me dwarven god, Thor," Whundrun says.

Whundrun closes his eyes and kneels down. "Mighty Thor, yer humble servant asks ye for aid."

An automated voice answers. "Hello! And welcome to ThorPrayer. To continue in English, chant 'one' now!"

Whundrun looks confused. "Ummm... one!"

If you know the name of the miracle you would like to request, chant 'one' now."

"One!" Whundrun says.

"Please intone the first three letters of the name of the miracle now."

Whundrun ponders. "Well, I want to heal ye, Elon, so... H-E-A!"

"You have selected, 'Heathen Smiting.' If this is correct, chant 'one.' If not, chant 'two.'"

Whundrun, shocked, chokes out a "two!"

"You have selected, 'Heat Blisters of Eternal Pain.' If this is correct, chant 'one.' If not, chant 'two.'"

Whundrun, panicking, shouts "two! TWO!"

"You have selected, 'Tumor.' To choose the type of tumor with which to smite Thor's enemies, chant 'three' now."

This continues for quite some time. Eventually, Elon is healed, but Whundrun looks a little sweaty.

It's getting late.

Turn to page 12 to rest for the night.
