"Fer this, I'll need to ask me dwarven god, Thor," Durkon says.

Durkon closes his eyes and kneels down. "Mighty Thor, yer humble servant asks ye for aid."

An automated voice answers. "Hello! And welcome to ThorPrayer. To continue in English, chant 'one' now!"

Durkon looks confused. "Ummm... one!"

If you know the name of the miracle you would like to request, chant 'one' now."

"One!" Durkon says.

"Please intone the first three letters of the name of the miracle now."

Durkon ponders. "Well, I want to heal ye, Elan, so... H-E-A!"

"You have selected, 'Heathen Smiting.' If this is correct, chant 'one.' If not, chant 'two.'"

Durkon, shocked, chokes out a "two!"

"You have selected, 'Heat Blisters of Eternal Pain.' If this is correct, chant 'one.' If not, chant 'two.'"

Durkon, panicking, shouts "two! TWO!"

"You have selected, 'Tumor.' To choose the type of tumor with which to smite Thor's enemies, chant 'three' now."

This continues for quite some time. Eventually, Elan is healed, but Durkon looks a little sweaty.

It's getting late.
